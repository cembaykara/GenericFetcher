# Pinboard

This is just a simple collectionView app to display a demo JSON object data. A custom layout file gives the layout simple customization options.

# Usage

Creating a layout
```swift
let layout = Layout(xSpacing: CGFLoat, ySpacing: CGFloat, columnCount: Int)
```
The first element will always take the full width.
